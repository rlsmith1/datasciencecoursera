This repository is a submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project in Coursera. It contains code to clean the Human Activity Recognition dataset for further analysis.

Data can be found at: [Human Activity Recognition dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

This repository contains the following files:

* CodeBook.md : describes the data and functions used to clean it

* run_analysis.R : performs data preparation by completing the following 5 steps, as per the project instructions:

       1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
       2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
       3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
       4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
       5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
       
* final_data.txt : the exported final data after completing the above steps.
