# Tasks to accomplish
# 
# Build a predictive model based on the previous data modeling steps - 
#      you may combine the models in any way you think is appropriate.
# Evaluate the model for efficiency and accuracy - 
#      use timing software to evaluate the computational complexity of your model. 
#      Evaluate the model accuracy using different metrics like perplexity, accuracy at the first word, second word, and third word.

# Questions to consider
# 
# How does the model perform for different choices of the parameters and size of the model?
#        How much does the model slow down for the performance you gain?
#        Does perplexity correlate with the other measures of accuracy?
#        Can you reduce the size of the model (number of parameters) without reducing performance?
